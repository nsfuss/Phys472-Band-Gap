# Phys472-Band-Gap
Code for data collection and analysis along with recorded data of the Band Gap experiement in the CWRU Physics department as part of Graduate and Senior level laboratory.

This exeriment aims to measure the band gap energy of the semiconductors Silicon and Germanium by measuring the current over a voltage sweep across p-n junction diodes at various temperatures. 

The apparatus used was a vacuum chamber with two thermoelectric coolers (one with PID control, the other controlled via an external switch mode power supply) along with a recirculating coolant loop to avoid heat build up. The 2 diodes were wired for 4-point measurement using 1 BNC per loop (2 per diode, 4 total). The current measurement loop sent a DC voltage from the positive lead of a voltage source to a picoammeter in series and then through the diode in series before returning to the negative lead of the voltage source. The voltage measurement loop, in parallel to the current loop simply took the voltage from either side of the diode into the postive and negative leads of a 6.5 digit DMM.
